# telemetry-framework

The telemetry framework is a project that aims to centralize metrics and events
of various platform components (not applications) in order to provide a
centralized view of multiple platform deployments.

Telemetry framework is also known as Service Assurance (SA), or Service
Assurance Framework, and naming may be interchangable throughout the
documentation.

## Documentation

Documentation is available at [Telemetry Framework (RTD)](https://telemetry-framework.readthedocs.io).

## Installation

Installation of the telemetry framework is currently being developed. The
recommended installation method out of this repository is currently to leverage
RHV (Red Hat Virtualization) on top of RHEL to build out a place to run the
initial bits of infrastructure.
