# telemetry-framework  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/redhat-service-assurance/telemetry-framework.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/redhat-service-assurance/telemetry-framework)

The telemetry framework is a project that aims to centralize metrics and events
of various platform components (not applications) in order to provide a
centralized view of multiple platform deployments.

## Development

The quickest way to start up Service Assurance Framework is to run the
`quickstart.sh` script located in the `deploy/` directory after starting up a
[Code Ready Containers](https://github.com/code-ready/crc) environment.

## Tech Preview
See the [official
documentation](https://redhat-service-assurance.github.io/saf-documentation)
for more information about installing for production-style use cases on OCP3.

Please use the `saf-ocp3` branchf for all such installations.
