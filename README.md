# DEPRECATED REPOSITORY telemetry-framework

Active work has moved here: https://github.com/redhat-service-assurance/service-assurance-operator/

The contents of this repository remain in order to preserve WIP patches (please delete your branches when you're done) and supporting existing Tech Preview installations.

## Tech Preview

See the [official
documentation](https://redhat-service-assurance.github.io/saf-documentation)
for more information about installing for production-style use cases on OCP3.

Please use [the legacy saf-ocp3 branch](https://github.com/redhat-service-assurance/telemetry-framework/tree/saf-ocp3) for all such installations.

As of the Generally Available SAF release, this repository is deprecated.
