# telemetry-framework

The telemetry framework is a project that aims to centralize metrics and events
of various platform components (not applications) in order to provide a
centralized view of multiple platform deployments.

Telemetry framework is also known as Service Assurance (SA), or Service
Assurance Framework, and naming may be interchangable throughout the
documentation.

## Documentation

Documentation is available at [Telemetry Framework (RTD)](https://telemetry-framework.readthedocs.io).

## Installation

Telemetry Framework can be deployed anywhere you have OpenShift running. To deploy from scratch on baremetal,
You can leverage [RHV (Red Hat Virtualization) on top of RHEL as your infrastructure
layer to run OpenShift](https://telemetry-framework.readthedocs.io/en/master/installation_platform.html).
Alternatively, you can run OpenShift on any public or private cloud. Once the prerequisites are satisfied,
follow the [Telemetry Deployment Guide](https://telemetry-framework.readthedocs.io/en/master/installation_telemetry_framework.html).
